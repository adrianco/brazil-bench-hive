## 1. Core Entity Definitions

### 1.1 Player Node

**Purpose**: Represents individual soccer players (current and historical)

**Label**: `:Player`

**Properties**:
```cypher
{
  player_id: STRING [REQUIRED, UNIQUE]  // Primary identifier (e.g., "P12345")
  name: STRING [REQUIRED]               // Full player name
  birth_date: DATE                      // Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  nationality: STRING [REQUIRED]        // Primary nationality
  position: STRING                      // Playing position (Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper)
  jersey_number: INTEGER                // Current/last jersey number
  height_cm: INTEGER                    // Height in centimeters
  weight_kg: INTEGER                    // Weight in kilograms
  preferred_foot: STRING                // Left, Right, or Both
  current_team_id: STRING               // Reference to current team (nullable)
  market_value_eur: INTEGER             // Market value in euros (if available)
  image_url: STRING                     // Player photo URL
  created_at: DATETIME                  // Record creation timestamp
  updated_at: DATETIME                  // Last update timestamp
}
```

**Business Rules**:
- `player_id` must be globally unique across all players
- `position` should use standardized values: "Forward", "Midfielder", "Defender", "Goalkeeper"
- Historical players may have null `current_team_id`
- `birth_date` enables age-based queries and career timeline analysis

  created_at: DATETIME
  updated_at: DATETIME
}
```

**Business Rules**:
- `team_id` must be unique across all teams

MATCH (p1:Player {player_id: $player1Id})-[r1:PLAYS_FOR]->(t:Team)<-[r2:PLAYS_FOR]-(p2:Player {player_id: $player2Id})
WHERE r1.start_date <= r2.end_date AND r2.start_date <= r1.end_date
RETURN t.name AS team, r1.start_date AS player1_start, r1.end_date AS player1_end,
       r2.start_date AS player2_start, r2.end_date AS player2_end;
```

## 5. Data Quality & Validation Rules

### 5.1 Referential Integrity

**Enforced via Application Logic** (Neo4j doesn't enforce foreign key constraints):

1. **Player.current_team_id** must reference existing Team.team_id
2. **Team.stadium_id** must reference existing Stadium.stadium_id
3. **Match.home_team_id** and **Match.away_team_id** must reference existing Team.team_id
4. **Match.competition_id** must reference existing Competition.competition_id
5. **SCORED_IN.assisted_by_player_id** must reference existing Player.player_id

### 5.2 Business Logic Validation

```cypher
// Validate no player has overlapping active contracts
MATCH (p:Player)-[r1:PLAYS_FOR]->(t1:Team)
MATCH (p)-[r2:PLAYS_FOR]->(t2:Team)
WHERE r1 <> r2
  AND r1.is_current = true
  AND r2.is_current = true
  AND NOT r1.is_on_loan
  AND NOT r2.is_on_loan
RETURN p.name, t1.name, t2.name;
// Should return empty result

// Validate match scores match relationship goals
MATCH (m:Match {match_id: $matchId})
MATCH (p:Player)-[scored:SCORED_IN {team_id: m.home_team_id}]->(m)
WITH m, count(scored) AS home_goals_from_relationships
WHERE m.home_score <> home_goals_from_relationships
RETURN m.match_id, m.home_score AS recorded_score, home_goals_from_relationships AS calculated_goals;
```

## 6. Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 6.1 Query Optimization Best Practices

1. **Use indexes**: Always filter on indexed properties
2. **Limit result sets**: Use `LIMIT` clause for large datasets
3. **Avoid Cartesian products**: Use `OPTIONAL MATCH` carefully
4. **Profile queries**: Use `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` to analyze execution plans

Example:
```cypher
PROFILE
MATCH (p:Player {name: "PelÃ©"})-[r:SCORED_IN]->(m:Match)
RETURN count(r);
```

### 6.2 Pre-computed Aggregations

For frequently accessed statistics, consider materialized views or cached properties:

```cypher
// Add career statistics to Player nodes (run periodically)
MATCH (p:Player)-[scored:SCORED_IN]->(m:Match)
WITH p, count(scored) AS total_goals
SET p.career_goals = total_goals;

// Then query becomes:
MATCH (p:Player) WHERE p.career_goals > 100
RETURN p.name, p.career_goals ORDER BY p.career_goals DESC;
```

## 7. Migration & Data Loading Strategy

### 7.1 Initial Load Order

1. **Reference Data First**: Stadium, Competition
2. **Core Entities**: Team, Coach, Player
3. **Relationships**: MANAGES, PLAYS_FOR
4. **Transactional Data**: Match
5. **Event Data**: COMPETED_IN, SCORED_IN, ASSISTED_IN, PLAYED_IN

### 7.2 Bulk Load Template (CSV)

```cypher
// Load Players
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///players.csv' AS row
CREATE (p:Player {
  player_id: row.player_id,
  name: row.name,
  birth_date: date(row.birth_date),
  nationality: row.nationality,
  position: row.position,
  created_at: datetime()
});

// Load PLAYS_FOR relationships
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///player_teams.csv' AS row
MATCH (p:Player {player_id: row.player_id})
MATCH (t:Team {team_id: row.team_id})
CREATE (p)-[r:PLAYS_FOR {
  start_date: date(row.start_date),
  end_date: CASE row.end_date WHEN '' THEN null ELSE date(row.end_date) END,
  is_current: row.is_current = 'true',
  jersey_number: toInteger(row.jersey_number)
}]->(t);
```

## 8. Extension Points

### 8.1 Future Entity Types

- **Referee**: Track referee assignments and performance
- **Transfer**: Separate node for transfer events with detailed attributes
- **Injury**: Track player injuries and recovery
- **Award**: Individual and team awards/honors

### 8.2 Future Relationships

- **RIVALS_WITH**: Define rivalry relationships between teams
- **MENTORED_BY**: Player mentorship relationships
- **TRAINED_AT**: Youth academy relationships
- **SPONSORED_BY**: Commercial sponsorships

## 9. Appendix: Complete Schema Initialization Script

```cypher
// ============================================================
// BRAZILIAN SOCCER KNOWLEDGE GRAPH - SCHEMA INITIALIZATION
// ============================================================
// Run this script to create the complete schema with constraints and indexes
// Execute in Neo4j Browser or via cypher-shell

// ------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. CREATE CONSTRAINTS

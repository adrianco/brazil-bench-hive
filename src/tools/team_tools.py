Brazilian Soccer MCP Server - Team Tools

CONTEXT:
This module implements MCP tools for team-related queries:
- search_team: Find teams by name or city
- get_team_roster: Get current or historical roster
- get_team_stats: Retrieve team statistics for a season
- get_team_history: Get complete team history including championships

CYPHER PATTERNS:
- MATCH (t:Team) for team nodes
- MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t) for roster
- MATCH (t)-[:COMPETED_IN]->(m:Match) for matches
- MATCH (m)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Competition) for competitions

DEPENDENCIES:
- src.database: Database connection management
- src.models: Data models for type safety

USAGE:
    from src.tools.team_tools import search_team, get_team_roster

    # Search for teams
    teams = await search_team(name="Flamengo")

    # Get team roster
    roster = await get_team_roster(team_id="T001", season="2023")

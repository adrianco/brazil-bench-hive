Brazilian Soccer MCP Server - Match Tools

CONTEXT:
This module implements MCP tools for match-related queries:
- get_match_details: Get detailed information about a specific match
- search_matches: Search for matches by team, date range, or competition
- get_head_to_head: Compare two teams' historical matchups
- get_match_scorers: List all goal scorers in a match

CYPHER PATTERNS:
- MATCH (m:Match) for match nodes
- MATCH (m)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Competition) for competition context
- MATCH (p:Player)-[:SCORED_IN]->(m) for goal scorers
- MATCH (m)-[:PLAYED_AT]->(s:Stadium) for venue information

DEPENDENCIES:
- src.database: Database connection management
- src.models: Data models for type safety

USAGE:
    from src.tools.match_tools import get_match_details, get_head_to_head

    # Get match details
    match = await get_match_details(match_id="M12345")

    # Get head-to-head stats
    h2h = await get_head_to_head(team1_id="T001", team2_id="T002")

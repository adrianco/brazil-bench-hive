Brazilian Soccer MCP Server - Data Models

CONTEXT:
This module defines all Pydantic models for the Brazilian Soccer Knowledge Graph.
These models provide type safety, validation, and serialization for:
- Players (personal info, career stats)
- Teams (club information)
- Matches (game results, events)
- Competitions (leagues, tournaments)
- Stadiums (venue information)
- Coaches (manager information)
- Relationships (transfers, goals, cards)

SCHEMA DESIGN:
Based on Neo4j graph database with nodes and relationships:
- Nodes: Player, Team, Match, Competition, Stadium, Coach
- Relationships: PLAYS_FOR, SCORED_IN, ASSISTED_IN, COMPETED_IN, etc.

DEPENDENCIES:
- pydantic: Data validation and serialization
- datetime: Date/time handling
- typing: Type hints

USAGE:

Shared BDD Step Definitions for Brazilian Soccer Knowledge Graph Tests

This module contains common Given-When-Then steps that are used across
multiple test suites to avoid code duplication.

Context:
- Shared across player, team, match, competition, and analysis tests
- Provides database verification, cleanup, and common preconditions
- Uses pytest context for sharing data between steps
